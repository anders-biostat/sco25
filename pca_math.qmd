title: "PCA / Rationale"

To assess human persoanilty, psychologists use questionaires. A common format is to ask whether the test subject feels well described by phrases ("personality items") like for example

- "I don't talk a lot."
- "I am interested in people."
- "I leave my belongings around."
- "I am relaxed most of the time."
- "I have difficulty understanding abstract ideas."

The subject is supposed to choose an answer on the *Likert scale*, i.e., say whether the statement is 

- "very inaccurate" (or: "strongly disagree")
- "moderately inaccurate" (or: "somwehat disagree")
- "neither accurate nor inaccurate" (or: "neither agree or disagree")
- "moderately accurate" (or: "somewhat agree")
- "very acccurate" (or: "strongly agree")

We can score these answers with valuies from 1 to 5, or from -2 to 2.
	
[Here](https://ipip.ori.org/AlphabeticalItemList.htm) is a list of 3000+ such statements (the "International Personality Item Pool" (IPIP)

It stands to reason that the answers to many such questions correlate, and that we can predict a subject's answer to one question if we know their answer to sufficiently many other questions. 

The theory of personality traits posits that human personality can be quantified along a rather small number of axes, spanning, e.g., from very introvert to very extrovert, or from very careful to very adventorous, or the like. We consider these as directions in a Euclidean-like space, the "personality space", i.e, we posit that a human's personality can be well described as a vector in such a space. Let us assume that human personality space can (to good approximation) be embedded in a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$, with $k$ a not too large number. We write $\mathbf{x}_i\in\mathbb{R}^k$ for the personality vector of subect $i$ and $Y_{ij}$ for the answer of subject $i$ to questionnaire item $j$.

Once we have fixed a basis for our personality space and thus established a mapping to $\mathbb{R}^k$ with its canonical basis, and assuming we knew the "personality vector" $\mathbb{x}_i\in\mathbb{R}^k$ of subject $i$, we can write our expectation for the subject's answer as
$$\text{E}(Y_{ij}) = y_{i0}+\sum_{r=1}^k a_{jr} x_{ir} =y_{i0}+\mathbf{a}_j^T\mathbf{x}_i,$$
where $a_{rj}$ is the strength and direction of the influence of personality dimension $r$ onto a subject's agreement with questionnaire item (statement) $j$. If a positive personality component along dimension $r$ makes a subject *dis*agree with item $i$, this value will be negative. We call the value $a_{jr}$ the *loading* of personality dimension $r$ on item $i$. 

Every question has also an *offset* $y_{i0}$ that describes the answer of the "zero subject" who has the zero vector $\mathbf{o}$ as personality vector. We will find it convenient to assume that the mapping of personality space to $\mathbb{R}^k$ is *centered*, by which we mean that it maps the "average subject" to $\mathbf{o}$, such that the expected value for any personality trait for a randomly picked subject is 0.

Note that we imply here that the personality traits' influence on the agreement with the item is *linear*.

The subject's actual answer, $y_{ij}$, will, of course deviate from this "prediction" by a "noise" term $\varepsilon_{ij}$:
$$ y_{ij} = y_{i0}+\mathbf{a}_j^T\mathbf{x}_i + \varepsilon_{ij}.$$
The offsets $y_{i0}$ are cumbersome. We will from now on drop them, i.e., assume that $y_{i0}=0$. In practice one would achieve this by "centering" the answers: For each item $i$, we calculate its average answer score over all subjects, $\frac{1}{m}\sum_i y_{ij}$, and, assuming that this is a good estimate for $y_{i0}$, simply subtract it from all answer scores. Hence, from now on,
$$ y_{ij} = \mathbf{a}_j^T\mathbf{x}_i + \varepsilon_{ij}.$$

We write $\mathbf{y}_i\in\mathbb{R}^n$ for the vector formed by the answers $y_{ij}$ of an given subject $i$ to all the items $j$ on the used questionnaire, which has $n$ items. If we have $m$ subjects, we can assemble an $m\times n$ data matrix $Y$ with all the answers. The rows of $Y$ are the subjects, the columns the questionnaire items. We can also form an $n\times k$ matrix $X$ whose rows are the subjects' personality vectors and an $m\times k$ matrix $A$ with the loadings. With this, we can write
$$ Y^T = A X^T + E,$$
where the matrix $E$ captures the "error" or "noise" terms $\varepsilon_{ij}$.

Let us now assume for a moment that there were no noise ($\varepsilon_{ij}=0$). Then, the vectors $\mathbf{y}_i$ all lie in a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, because $A$ is a linear map from $\mathbb{R}^k$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let us call this subspace $S$. It is the subspace spanned by the solumns of $A$.

With (not too strong) noise, the $\mathbf{y}_i$ are no longer exactly on the subspace but close to it. Thus, if we projected them onto the subspace, we would not change the vectors much.

So, if we are only given $Y$, how do we find $S$? And how do we find its dimensionality, $k$?

Let us write $P:\mathbb{R}^n\to S\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ for the orthogonal projection onto $S$. If we find $P$, we also get $S$. With this, we can decompose a subject's answer vector $\mathbb{y}_i$ into their expected answer $\mathbf{Y}^S_i$ and the noise contribution $\mathbf{y}^\perp_i\perp\mathbf{y}_i$:
$$ \mathbf{y}_i=\mathbf{y}_i^S+\mathbf{y}_i^\perp\qquad\text{with }\mathbf{y}_i^S=P\mathbf{y}_i.$$
It seems natural to search for the $P$ that minimizes $\sum_i\|\mathbf{y}_i^\perp\|_2^2=\sum_{ij}(y^\perp_{ij})^2$, i.e. that minimizes $\|(I-P)Y^T\|_F^2$, or maximizes $\|PY^T\|_F^2$. (Here, $\|M\|_F=\sqrt{\sum_{ij}m_{ij}^2}$ is the Froebenius norm, a matrix norm that simply adds up the squares of all matrix elements and then takes the square root.)
